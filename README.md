## To Run

Clone this repo.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Notes on the Build

- Built using Angular 4
- Manually tested on Chrome and Firefox
- Not compatible with IE or Edge due to CSS Grid.
- Responsive down to iPhone 5 size.

## Notes on the Instructions

The instructions state to use TrpRating to order and filter the data. This was not a property in the json data so has been omitted from this project.

## What I Would Do With More Time

- Improved Styling - My focus was to achieve the desired functionality so styling is minimal.
- Add Pagination to speed up rendering.
- Pull json data from a server.
- Implement Tests
